Tic-Tac-Toe for iOS
================================
(last updated: Oct 18, 2015)

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created in Swift, the iOS programming language. Swift was designed and launched by Apple Inc. in 2014. The language is based on Objective-C.

**Game Features:**
There is a single and multi-player state. The game is fully functional and stable at 60fps on an iPhone 5s/6. The game has simple animations using the “Spring” animation library.
In singleplayer the player goes up against the simple A.I. (a Tic Tac Toe algorithm).

Design
======

All the user interface elements were designed by Ben Emdon in Sketch for OS X. Rounded edges and minimalistic colour sets were used to keep the app as simple and intuitive as possible.
